# remember you can use individual functions from the module without specifying the module prefix with
# from debug import dprint, set_debug_level
# IF YOU DO THIS, you will need to use the functions: set_debug_level, set_delay_level and set_error_log 
# to change the settings of the module.

# set the debug level - decides what to show of your debug messages

# set the delays level. independent from debug level.
